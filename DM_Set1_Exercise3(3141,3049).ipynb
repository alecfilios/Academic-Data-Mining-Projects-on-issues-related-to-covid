    "##### Notes and Conclusions\n",
    "Anyone can easily notice a variety of differences between the two-ways usage of the User-User Collaborative Filtering algoritmh. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first version of the algorithm the most similar users with UserX turned out to be the users Y,W and not the user Z. If somone observe the matrix carefully , he will notice that the 2/3 of the rating for UserX and the 2/3 of the ratings for userZ have to do with the same movies. Similarity also noticed in the way they rated the movies. Both of them gave their best ratings in the movie1 and their worst ratings in the movie4 . Νevertheless the algorithm don't concider them as similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Οn the contrary for the first version of algorithm the UserW seems to be more similar to UserX than UserZ. Αltough the UserW gave one of the lowest ratings to movie1 ,while the UserX gave his best.Also the UserW gave his best rating in movie4 , while UserX gave his worst. That's happening because the algorithm doesn't take under concideration the way the users rate , but only the values of ratings.From the other hand the second implementation of the algorithm with the normilization , gives us a better result . That' s happening because ratings are highly influenced by the scale of individuals. Some individuals are kind-hearted while rating and tend to rate high, whereas others are just cold-hearted and tend to give medium ratings for good content. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is one way to compensate for such a user's behavior by adjusting the scale of rating to be comparable or on the same level to other user’s ratings.The final value , that the second version of algithm predicts,seems to be more logical.The algorithm predicts the value 3, which is the same value that userZ rated the movie6. Also the userZ is now the most similar user to UserX. The value 3 is the rounded value of 2,879. Is kinda smaller from the value of UserZ,altough the UserX seems to be a little bit more kind-hearted than UserZ. That's happening because the UserY , who also seems similar with UserX,rated this movie with 1 , but he also seems to be a little bit more cold-hearted than UserX and he has less similarity with UserX than UserZ has,so his rating didn't affect UserX 's rating so much. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion the second algirthm give us better results for the similarity of users and the predicted value too. That's happening because this version take under concideration the way the users rate , not only their ratings. In the first version the values of all cells has the same value , but in the second verison the cells with extreme-low or extreme- high ratings have greater value. Also in the second version we calculate the weighted deviation between the most similar users to Userx and the average rating of UserX and taking into account both of the values, calculate the final result.
